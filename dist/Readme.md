This was a mostly successful attempt at building an image heavy responsive website.

I ran into trouble when I tried to make the navbar responsive and snap to the top when the screen
size reached 1000px and smaller. This feature still does not work and I plan to return to this project once my understanding of grid and navbar layout improves. I did not want to use bootstrap for the navbar because I believe it should be possible with only grid. At this point I decided to stop working on this for the moment because my code was becoming very unwieldy as I began tacking on classes and !importants just to try to get it to work. This was bad practice but due ot my knowledge I did not see another way to continue in good style.

Stay tuned!
